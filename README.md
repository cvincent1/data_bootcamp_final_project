# Problem Statement:
Wine quality is a metric in the winemaking industry that can 'make or break' the success seen by a vineyard. Reviews and scoring are used in shaping consumer preferences, guiding production standards, and determining market success. For my final project, I wanted to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating the quality of red wines. I come from an Italian/English family that loves red wine, so when I was parsing through datasets on Kaggle, this caught my eye. The dataset I found focuses specifically on Portugal's renowned "Vinho Verde" variety. Vinho Verde, a traditional wine from the northern region of Portugal, comes in both red and white wine. While the white variant is more widely recognized for its light, crisp taste, the red Vinho Verde is equally unique, offering bold flavors and a distinct tartness. Both wines are renowned for their versatility and refreshing qualities. I have actually had the pleasure of trying Vinho Verde (Professor Koehler, I am 21 years old :) btw) when I noticed it was available at Astor Wines. I had the 2022 Vinho Verde "Biotite" by Ant√≥nio Lopes Ribeiro, and it was quite good!
This project will focus specifically on the red variant of Vinho Verde, utilizing a dataset of 'physicochemical' properties and sensory outputs to predict wine quality scores on a scale from 0 to 10(although the scores range in the dataset from 3 to 8). These scores, typically determined through analysis by wine experts, reflect the wine's success with consumers. Developing a predictive model like this could have the potential to provide valuable insights into how specific chemical properties, such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol, can impact the perceived quality of a bottle of wine. Producers, winemakers, or vineyard owners can use these insights to make changes to their production methods, ensure better consistency, and create wines that align more closely with consumer expectations based on the model's findings.
##Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on the properties of red Vinho Verde wines. This dataset includes features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, pH, sulfur dioxide levels, alcohol content, and other variables that influence the overall profile of red wines. Additionally, it contains a wine quality score assigned by trained tasters, which serves as the target variable for the regression model. While this data provides a great amount of information, challenges may arise due to potential outliers in the dataset, as well as the naturally subjective nature of wine quality scoring. Before diving into testing, I will take a few steps to clean the data and address any missing values or anomalies that may come up.
