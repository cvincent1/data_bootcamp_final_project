# Problem Statement:
Wine quality is a metric in the winemaking industry that can 'make or break' the success seen by a vineyard. Reviews and scoring are used in shaping consumer preferences, guiding production standards, and determining market success. For my final project, I wanted to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating the quality of red wines. I come from an Italian/English family that loves red wine, so when I was parsing through datasets on Kaggle, this caught my eye. The dataset I found focuses specifically on Portugal's renowned "Vinho Verde" variety. Vinho Verde, a traditional wine from the northern region of Portugal, comes in both red and white wine. While the white variant is more widely recognized for its light, crisp taste, the red Vinho Verde is equally unique, offering bold flavors and a distinct tartness. Both wines are renowned for their versatility and refreshing qualities. I have actually had the pleasure of trying Vinho Verde (Professor Koehler, I am 21 years old :) btw) when I noticed it was available at Astor Wines. I had the 2022 Vinho Verde "Biotite" by Ant√≥nio Lopes Ribeiro, and it was quite good!
This project will focus specifically on the red variant of Vinho Verde, utilizing a dataset of 'physicochemical' properties and sensory outputs to predict wine quality scores on a scale from 0 to 10(although the scores range in the dataset from 3 to 8). These scores, typically determined through analysis by wine experts, reflect the wine's success with consumers. Developing a predictive model like this could have the potential to provide valuable insights into how specific chemical properties, such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol, can impact the perceived quality of a bottle of wine. Producers, winemakers, or vineyard owners can use these insights to make changes to their production methods, ensure better consistency, and create wines that align more closely with consumer expectations based on the model's findings.
##Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on the properties of red Vinho Verde wines. This dataset includes features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, pH, sulfur dioxide levels, alcohol content, and other variables that influence the overall profile of red wines. Additionally, it contains a wine quality score assigned by trained tasters, which serves as the target variable for the regression model. While this data provides a great amount of information, challenges may arise due to potential outliers in the dataset, as well as the naturally subjective nature of wine quality scoring. Before diving into testing, I will take a few steps to clean the data and address any missing values or anomalies that may come up.

Similar to a test I performed in my midterm project, I will look to identify which numerical features have the strongest correlation with quality in the wine dataset and determine the statistical significance of these relationships. I will do this by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values for all numerical features against the target quality. Then, I will sort them into a DataFrame to rank features based on their correlation strengths.
The resulting table displays the following for each feature: Correlation Coefficient:
Positive Correlations:
Alcohol (0.476): This has the strongest positive relationship with quality. Higher alcohol content appears to correlate with better wine quality.
Sulfates (0.251): Positively correlated with quality as well, though weaker than Alcohol's correlation.
Negative Correlations:
Volatile acidity (-0.390): This test shows a strong negative correlation, meaning higher volatile acidity (essentially a vinegary taste) tends to decrease quality.
Density, Total sulfur dioxide, and Chlorides are also negatively correlated with quality but have relatively low correlations. ps (P-Value):
P-values close to 0, such as 2.831477e-91 for Alcohol, indicate strong statistical significance. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that the correlation is not due to random chance.
Residual sugar has a very high p-value (0.583), indicating no significant relationship with wine quality. As a result, I will not consider residual sugar moving forward, as it has little effect on perceived wine quality.

I will now move into visualizing the relationships between wine quality and some variables that had higher levels of correlation with it.
  This graph shows the relationship between volatile acidity and wine quality scores. As the quality score increases, volatile acidity decreases significantly, suggesting an inverse relationship between the two. Wines with lower volatile acidity tend to receive higher quality ratings. Based on a quick Google search, I learned that this trend is common across most wines. High volatile acidity, which indicates higher levels of acetic acid (vinegar-like flavors), is typically considered undesirable and negatively affects wine quality. Oenological studies support this inverse relationship and is a consistent finding in wine quality research. I figured that a line graph was appropriate here because it effectively shows the trend or pattern in the relationship between the volatile acidity and quality score more than a bar graph would.
  This bar graph shows the relationship between citric acid concentration and quality scores of wine. As the wine quality score increases, the average citric acid concentration also rises, suggesting a positive relationship between citric acid levels and wine quality. Higher quality wines seem to have higher citric acid content. Again, this seems to represent wine generally speaking as citric acid contributes to the freshness and acidity balance of wines, which is often associated with a more pleasant and crisp taste. Wines with higher citric acid levels are typically viewed as having better structure and complexity, leading to higher quality ratings.
